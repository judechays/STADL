Description: This package contains multiple functions that help create  
     geographic spatial weights matrices and estimate spatial lag models. 
     At present, it can estimate weights matrices of unbalanced data until 
     year 2019. It also provides researchers with tools to estimate a Spatial 
     AutoRegressive (SAR) lag model, error model (SEM), and Spatial Autocorrelation (SAC).
